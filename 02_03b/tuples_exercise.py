# Basic Tuple Operations

# Create an empty tuple

# Create a tuple with multiple elements

# Access an element by index

# Count occurrences of an element

# Find the index of an element

# Check if an element exists

# Iterate through the tuple

# Concatenate two tuples

# Slice a tuple (extract elements from index 1 to 2)

# Create a tuple with different data types

# Length of a tuple

# Attempting to modify a tuple raises an error
# my_tuple[1] = 25  # Uncomment to see: TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

# Unpack tuple elements into variables

# Create a tuple comprehension (using generator with tuple())
