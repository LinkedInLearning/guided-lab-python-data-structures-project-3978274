## Course Description

<p>This course provides a practical introduction to core Python data structures, including lists, dictionaries, stacks, and priority queues. Learners will build a functional task management application step by step, incorporating each data structure incrementally to understand its purpose and use. Starting with simple lists for data storage, instructor Robin Andrews then progresses to using dictionaries for key-value mapping, stacks for undo functionality, and priority queues for task prioritization.  By the end of this course, you’ll have acquired hands-on experience of working with core Python data structures, and be empowered to solve problems more effectively by knowing how to choose the best structures for your development goals.</p><p>This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time, all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out “Using GitHub Codespaces" with this course to learn how to get started.</p>

## Instructions

The repository for this course is organised into folders for each chapter. The state of the code at the beginning of a chapter is identified with a "b" suffix, and for the end of the chapter, an "e" suffix. For example, folder 03_02e is where you will find the code relevant to the end of chapter 3 section 2.

You may wish to use GitHub Codespaces for this course, if you wish to work locally without the need to download the repository for any local machine setup. To do this, select the green CODE button, then the Codespaces tab followed by "create codespace on main."

Tip: To have the "run" button in VS code run the current script from the current directory, click the cogwheel for settings and start typing python.terminal. You will see a checkbox for "Execute in File Dir." Select this, then close the currently opened terminal. Next time you click "run" the new setting will apply.



## Working with Course Files Locally
