## Instructions

The repository for this course is organised into folders for each chapter. The state of the code at the beginning of a chapter is identified with a "b" suffix, and for the end of the chapter, an "e" suffix. For example, folder 03_02e is where you will find the code relevant to the end of chapter 3 section 2.

You may wish to use GitHub Codespaces for this course, if you wish to work locally without the need to download the repository for any local machine setup. To do this, select the green CODE button, then the Codespaces tab followed by "create codespace on main."
