# Python priority queue using heapq Operations

# Import the heapq module

# Create a list of tasks, each with a priority (e.g., 1-5, with 1 as the highest).
# We will store the tasks as tuples with (priority, task).

# Create a priority queue by using heapq.heapify() on the tasks list.

# View the priority queue to see how the tasks are organized by priority

# Add a new task to the priority queue with heappush():

# View the updated priority queue

# Remove the highest priority task (the one with the smallest priority number) using heappop():

# View the priority queue again after removing the task.
